We are creating API

we use CGI

Get the example of SSH

Witthout login to one os to another OS we need to execute a command

For running one system to another we need

Networking
Interface or gateway for enter into the server.

Normally we sent a packet with which we have our code

This door is called common gateway interface.

For once we need to run CGI for that we need webserver software(Apache)

Apache by default enables CGI

Any file in the drectory /var/www/cgi-bin
It will treated as cgi code.

In var/www/html all user fron protocol http they can view the content
For execute the content we need to perform as CGI

For runing the program file we need to  copy the files in the directory /var/www/cgi-bin


Typically running the code is called deploy the code

If we need to run the code we need to copy the file to /var/www/cgi-bin

For running the file we need to change the URL ip/cgi-bin/hello.py

There will be 3 type of issues:

The file not executable
Internally webserver is running the program. The webserver defaultly dont know which language the program is written.

#! this symbol we say which language the file is written.


1
Copy file to cgi-bin
2
chmod +x file.py
3
#!/user/bin/python3


The webserver confuse which type of condent is coming. video or audio So we need to provide what will be the output
This is the need of presentation layer in OSI model


If we want the output in the way in html we need to provide the which format we want

content-type:text/html
This must be provide in the python code.

The file we need
print("content-type: text/html")
print()

The browser will first as which is the content type which is reserved to the browser for asking which is the content-type.

This first line is called header

The delimiter for the header is a gap between the space of the content type and the code
We need to use 
print()



It basically tell the webserver the that we dont need to see the content of the code. We just want to get the output the code.
Output ------------ body part
Differentiator we need to give new line
header ----------- header part

Client not able to run the code manually
Client only get the data which is in output.


So by a URL we give the client a facility to intract with the server.To do something in the server without can having login to the system. This is called API or Application Programming interface.

Here search is the program they hide the extantion.
CGI is the way which the client coming to run the command.
