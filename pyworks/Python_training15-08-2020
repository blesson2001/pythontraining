For run any of the program

we need to OS command for the application to  open  the  application in  python.

We can open VLC player

os.system("vlc")

IDE ----- Its is the software for the developer

The  code we send to the customer.

We need to create a file with .py extention

import pyttsx3
import os
pyttsx3.speak("Welcome to my tools")
p=input("Enter the program need to run : ")
os.system(p)


Save this in  the file  and run python myapp.py

In python n is specical charactor
n is also used for new line in order to get the new line we user "\n"
t is also used for tab function , in order to get that we use "\t"


So in order  to print the exact same output we print the r in front of the  code.

Print will always give new line.

we have change print giving new line wont work in python 2.6
We can  look in to the syntax and  manual of print for that we use 
help(print)
For modules
help(pyttsx3.speak)


Python never use curly braces

The block of code ending is identified by python by the space.

This space giving is called intetation.This compelsary

if exp>=2:
  print("give job")
  print("card")
  print("bank")
else:
  print("not give a job")
  print(bye")

  
In python interpretoralso ask for the intentation.
We need to give colum after the is expression.


The input function always convert  the input  to a string.

In order to convert the string into the number we user int(x)
