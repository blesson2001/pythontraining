Sound recoganication

Voice control:-

In order to connect python with the mic driver we need to use a library.

The libraby have a cabpability.


we use the function pyaudio


dont directly install

install via canda


Coverting th our speech to text is called  speech recoganisation.


We need recoganiser for our speech convertor


So we need to connect to google recoganizoer


We can give nick name for the function.

like 

import subprocess as sp

sp is also called alias

Speech recoganizor will use pyaudio internally

when we enter the function speech_recognition.Microphone

In order to record the audio we use with

with sr.Micrphone() as source:
     r.listen(source)
     
This will store the frequency coming from the microphone will store in source.
'with' will help to open and closing 



import speech_recognition as sr
print("welcome to the tools")
import webbrowser
print("enter your requirement:", end='')
#ch=input()
r=sr.Recognizer()
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("start say!!")
    audio=r.listen(source)
    print("speech Done")
ch=r.recognize_google(audio)
if "date" in ch:
    print("date")
    webbrowser.open("http://54.169.27.197/cgi-bin/me.py?c=date")
elif "calendar" in ch:
    print("cal")
    webbrowser.open("http://54.169.27.197/cgi-bin/me.py?c=cal")
elif "list" in ch:
    print("ls")
    webbrowser.open("http://54.169.27.197/cgi-bin/me.py?c=ls")    
else:
    print("not understand")
