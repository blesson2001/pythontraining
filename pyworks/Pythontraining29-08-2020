Space complexity

Normal text contents in a website index page is called as ---- static webpage

If the page contains a code is called ----- webapp

Python Integration with frondend/html

For input() function will prompt yoyu for the value in terminal

For frondend we need feildstorage() for promting the area in GUI.

Who will give the input?

In backend we are giving the input

frontend clinet are giving input

So client sending data via network via http protocal.

For that we need to create boxes for input the data for the client and get data from the client.

Here comes the chance for input box.

Google search engine using the input box.


HTML only help you to create a page.

For view anything display in webpage we need to use html.


Create a webpage and provide a input box

HTML

Webserver never run the code in the static webpage


We can view entair code via right click the view page source.

Browser will process the symbols

All the browser contains html interpreter.

The data which is type by the client need to send to the server. We cant send it via directly we need to assign the data using a variable name.

So we put it as <input name-'x' type="text" />


When we need to store the data we use form 

<form action="https://www.google.com/search" >

We need go the variable to our data and it must comes to the cgi-bin code. For that we need to use the function called feildstorage.

Before that we need to import the module called cgi.


#!/bin/python3
import subprocess
import cgi
print("content-type: text/html")
print()


h=cgi.FieldStorage()
o=h.getvalue("x")
print(o)

y=subprocess.getoutput(o)
print(y)

x=5
print(x)
print("hello")


It is one of the Dynamic webapplication
