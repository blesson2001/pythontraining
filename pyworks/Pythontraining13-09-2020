Docker integration:-

Docker basics

import subprocess
import os
cmd="docker container run --name do ubuntu:18.04"
x=subprocess.getstatusoutput(cmd)
status=x[0]
output=x[1]
print(status)


treat valiable inside the double quotes as variable.python always treat the text in  the Double quotes as string


print("This is x date")

x must be varible


os we use {} inside the double quotes of the print and input command


 print("This is {} date".format(x))

We use x property for the string for capturing the value of the variable.

{} --- place holder

format(x) --- this is called interpolation

We can use 2 varible in this way respectively

print("This is {} and {}".format(x,y))

This will take respectivly


this box is show like tuple


print("This is {0} and{1}".format(x.y))

This process also called interpolation
